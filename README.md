Final Project (25% of your class grade)

Your team is one of many teams working for Jaguar Analytics.  For this project, your team will need to wear the hats of both a Type I and Type II data scientist.

Data sets that you will be allowed to use.
o	Any data at www.data.gov
o	90 United States cities have open data portals - https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2018/04/29/city-governments-making-public-data-easier-to-get-90-municipal-open-data-portals/#342a44135a0d

o	Open data portals around the world –

Assignment 1 (Due March 30)
•	Who are the members of your team?
•	What is your team name?
•	What data set does your team want to use? (URL)?
•	Why did your team pick this data set?

For this project you will first start out as a Type II Data Scientist.

Introduction (20%)
Questions that will need to be answered:
1.	Why did your team pick this data set?
2.	What is the web link to this data set?
3.	Anytime you are dealing with secondary data you need to assess the overall quality of your data set.
a.	Does your data set have all the information that you need or are granular details missing that should have been included when the data was gathered?
b.	Does this impact the creation of your research question?
4.	Research questions. For this project your team will need to have (1+ the number of team members) research questions.  So if your group has two team members, your team will need to create three research question.

Assignment 2 (Due April 13):
a.	What are your team’s research questions?
b.	How did you arrive at these research questions?
c.	Will all of your research questions provide value? How?
d.	What are some of the research questions that were rejected and why were they rejected?

Now we move to the Type I Data Scientist.
	Analysis (30%)
You will need to load your data set into Hadoop.
•	You can use the class version of Cloudera’s old platform but I would highly suggest using the more robust Hortonworks Data Platform Sandbox that is available at https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/hortonworks-sandbox.html
•	Cloudera provides a tutorial called Learning the Ropes of the HDP Sandbox that available at https://www.cloudera.com/tutorials/learning-the-ropes-of-the-hdp-sandbox.html

For your research questions, you will be mining your data using the programs Hive, Impala, Spark, and possibly Pig.  At least one of the research questions must be programmed using Spark or Pig. How do you pick which research question to answer with Spark or Pig?
Read the following web page: http://www.hadoopwizard.com/when-to-use-pig-latin-versus-hive-sql/.
It is suggested that the entire group work on the Spark and Pig Latin programs together. Cloudera has a Beginners Guide to Apache Pig and How to Process Apache Pig tutorials that are available at https://www.cloudera.com/tutorials/how-to-process-data-with-apache-pig.html many of these tutorials requires you to provide consent to use get to the tutorial. 

The remaining queries you will be able to use Hive or Impala which is very similar to SQL.
Questions that you will need to answer.
1.	What research question did you decide to program in Spark or Pig and why?
2.	What are the scripts for each of your queries? (single spaced)
3.	How will you visualize your findings?

For Assignment 3 (Due April 20):
•	What research question did you decide to program in Pig or Spark and why? 
•	Are you running into any problems running your queries?
•	What percentage of your queries have your completed?
•	What do you have remaining for the project?

Now you are back to Type II Data Scientist mode.
	Presenting your findings (30%)
For each of your research questions answer the following question:
1.	How is your research question answered with the visualization created?
2.	What are the measurable results?
3.	What story is this data leading you to believe?
4.	What business action do you think needs to take place because of the results of your research question?

Conclusion (10%)
Question that needs to be answered
1.	What did you learn by doing this project?
2.	What would you change if you did this project over again?



Format for the report: 
Times New Roman 12 point font, one inch margins, double spaced.
Team member names are included on the front page of your report

•	Introduction (20%)
•	Analysis (30%)
•	Presenting Your Findings (30%)
•	Conclusion (10%)

•	Proper capitalization, spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, spelling, and word usage matter
o	 (10% of your grade)
o	 No errors – 10 points
o	 Less than 5 errors – 8 points
o	 More than 5 and less than 15 errors – 5 points
o	 More than 15 errors  - 0 points

All Assignments will be turned in on USA Online and are due BEFORE class on the due date.

The Final Project Report is due at 3:30 pm on Monday, May 4 and TurnItIn will be used on this assignment. 

Your Project Presentation slides are also due at 3:30 pm on Monday, May 4.

I highly suggest using the Writing Center to improve your writing!

Final Presentation (15% of your final grade)

Presentation should be between 10 and 15 minutes.
All team members must participate in the development and delivery of the presentation
All presenters should avoid reading notes and maintain eye contact with the audience at least 50% of the time.
All presentations must address all the points stated below.

Presentation should address the following items:
1.	Introduction of the team.
2.	Why did your team pick your data set?
3.	Any data quality issues, items you wish your data set included.
4.	What are your research questions and how did you arrived at them?
5.	Process for analyzing your data.
6.	What differences did your team members find between programming in Pig and Hive?
7.	What are the findings of your research questions? (Can the audience draw the same conclusions based on your visualization?)
8.	What would your group do differently if you had to do this project again?
